# League of Legends ARAM Mode Personal Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of personal data in League of Legends' ARAM (All Random All Mid) mode. ARAM is a popular game mode in League of Legends where players are assigned random champions and battle on a single lane called the "Howling Abyss."

The goal of this project is to gather personal data related to ARAM matches and perform various analyses to gain insights into gameplay performance, champion statistics, win rates, and more. By analyzing this data, we aim to discover patterns, trends, and strategies that can enhance our understanding of ARAM gameplay.

## Data Collection
To collect the necessary data, we utilize the Riot Games API, which provides access to various game-related information. We retrieve data such as match history, champion statistics, player rankings, and match details specifically related to ARAM mode. The API allows us to access the data programmatically and store it for further analysis.

## Analysis Techniques
Once the data is collected, we employ various analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights. These techniques include:

1. **Win Rate Analysis**: We calculate the win rate for different champions in ARAM mode to identify the most successful and popular picks.
2. **Performance Metrics**: We analyze individual performance metrics such as kill-death-assist (KDA) ratios, damage dealt, healing done, and other relevant statistics to evaluate player performance.
3. **Item Build Analysis**: We examine the most commonly purchased items by players in ARAM mode to identify popular and effective item builds.
4. **Team Composition Analysis**: We explore the impact of team compositions on win rates and identify synergistic or optimal champion combinations.
5. **Game Duration Analysis**: We investigate the average game duration in ARAM mode and examine factors that contribute to shorter or longer matches.

## Results and Visualizations
The results of our analysis are presented through informative visualizations such as graphs, charts, and tables. These visual representations help in understanding the patterns and trends in ARAM gameplay more intuitively. We aim to provide clear and concise summaries of our findings to make the results easily interpretable.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the collected data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the setup instructions.
3. Run the data collection script to retrieve the latest ARAM match data from the Riot Games API.
4. Execute the analysis scripts to perform various analyses and generate visualizations.
5. Explore the generated results and visualizations to gain insights into ARAM gameplay.

## Contributions and Future Enhancements
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for additional analysis techniques, data visualizations, or any other improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. We believe in the collaborative nature of open-source projects and appreciate any contributions that can enhance the project.

In the future, we plan to expand this project to include more in-depth analysis, such as advanced statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and comparison with other game modes. We also aim to create a web interface or dashboard for easier data exploration and visualization.
