# League of Legends Personal Data Analysis Project

English | [简体中文](./README.md)

## Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze individual data related to the game "League of Legends" (LOL), with a 
potential emphasis on the ARAM (All Random All Mid) game mode.

The goal of this project is to collect personal data relevant to LOL matches and conduct various analyses to gain 
insights into game performance, hero statistics, win rates, and other aspects. By analyzing this data, we aim to 
uncover patterns, trends, and strategies within the game mode, thereby enhancing our understanding of the game.

## Data Collection

To collect the necessary data, we will utilize the Riot Games API, which provides various pieces of information related
to the game.

We will use the API to retrieve data such as match history, hero statistics, player rankings, and detailed match 
information relevant to "League of Legends" (LOL) matches. The API allows us to programmatically access this data and 
store it for further analysis.

By leveraging the Riot Games API, we can efficiently gather and organize the data required to perform in-depth analyses 
on individual gameplay, hero performance, and other relevant aspects of the game. This will enable us to gain valuable 
insights and draw conclusions to enhance our understanding of the game and potentially uncover trends or strategies 
within each game mode.


## Analysis Techniques

Once the data is collected, we employ various analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights. These techniques
include:

1. **Win Rate Analysis**: We calculate the win rate for different champions in each mode to identify the most successful
   and popular picks.
2. **Performance Metrics**: We analyze individual performance metrics such as kill-death-assist (KDA) ratios, damage
   dealt, healing done, and other relevant statistics to evaluate player performance.
3. **Item Build Analysis**: We examine the most commonly purchased items by players in each mode to identify popular and
   effective item builds.
4. **Team Composition Analysis**: We explore the impact of team compositions on win rates and identify synergistic or
   optimal champion combinations.
5. **Game Duration Analysis**: We investigate the average game duration in each mode and examine factors that contribute
   to shorter or longer matches.

## Results and Visualizations

The results of our analysis are presented through informative visualizations such as graphs, charts, and tables. These
visual representations help in understanding the patterns and trends in each gameplay more intuitively. We aim to
provide clear and concise summaries of our findings to make the results easily interpretable.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the collected data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the setup instructions.
3. Run the data collection script to retrieve the latest each match data from the Riot Games API.
4. Execute the analysis scripts to perform various analyses and generate visualizations.
5. Explore the generated results and visualizations to gain insights into each gameplay.

## Contributions and Future Enhancements

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for additional analysis techniques, data visualizations, or
any other improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. We believe in the collaborative
nature of open-source projects and appreciate any contributions that can enhance the project.

In the future, we plan to expand this project to include more in-depth analysis, such as advanced statistical modeling,
predictive analytics, and comparison with other game modes. We also aim to create a web interface or dashboard for
easier data exploration and visualization.
